### TweetGPT

This is a simple Python script that uses OpenAI's Chat API to generate tweets and post them to a Twitter account. Before you run this script, make sure to follow these steps:

1. Set up a Twitter Developer account and create a new app: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps
2. Get the API keys and access tokens for your Twitter app
3. Install the necessary libraries (`tweepy` and `openai`) using pip:
`pip install tweepy`
`pip install openai`
4. Set it and forget it with a cron job

## See it in action!

I use this script for a Twitter account called [Reel Riddles](https://twitter.com/ReelRiddles) that posts riddles about scenes from popular movies. The script itself works great but the prompt could use some engineering. Have fun!
